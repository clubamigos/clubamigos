        <h2>About Club Amigos</h2>
        <p>Club Amigos was first registered under the NGO Act on 7th February 2011. After the introduction of the Commissioner of Sports, it was re-registered under that act on 30th October 2017.</p>
        <p>Since its establishment, the club has actively participated in 3rd Division Tournaments, FA Cups which was organized by FAM, as well as Futsal and Street Soccer competitions.</p>
        <p>Our most notable achievements include reaching the semi-finals of the Independence Day Futsal Tournament organized by the Ministry of Youth & Sports, as well as the highly competitive “Abo” Futsal Tournament — an event that featured many of the top players in the country.</p>
